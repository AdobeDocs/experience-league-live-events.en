title: Measure people instead of devices
description: When users interact with your brand they do so in many ways and on multiple "surfaces" or "devices." They might use a web browser on a PC or mobile device, or they may use a mobile app. In traditional digital analytics, which grew up in data collection based on cookies, each of these surfaces is represented as a unique "visitor." With Cross-Device Analytics in Adobe Analytics, you can now measure a person's activity across devices, analyzing people instead of devices. In this Experience League LIVE episode, discover how Cross-Device Analytics works, how to set it up, some technical requirements, and great use cases. Also see the results in Analysis Workspace to see how it can benefit your company.
